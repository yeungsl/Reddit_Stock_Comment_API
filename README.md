## Description
This project is just to recreate the idea from a [reddit website](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bn33ap/did_you_ever_want_to_inverse_the_trades_of_what/) where I parsed all the comment of the reddit users on channel [/Stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) [/WallStreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and implment NLP to process all the comments as list of qunatitative information about how people's comment and thoughts about a particular stock.
